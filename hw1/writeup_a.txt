So to increase the accuracy, i tried to add a lot of features in the starting but that didnt give good results 
I tried to add the features one by one and check how its affecting the accuracy.
1. I tried to make use of all the word lists which was created before, just by using that my accuracy was high by 5%.
2. First, for titles. I checked if the previous word was a title. if its a title then the full stop after that is not a end of sentence.
3. next, for proper nouns. usually most of the time the proper nous will not be the end of sentence so i inlcuded it
4. i have also made use of timeframes, the words related to time will help in determing the EOS
5. I also included the len of the 3 words beofore and after. I'm checking if there is any capital letter in the words 
6. i also checked in the period in present in the word. if its present it is most probably the abbrevation
7. so, these features allow the model to recognize patterns where the presence of specific characters 
within words influences the decision about whether a period signifies the end of a sentence.
8. I implemented the logic classifier but that reduced my accuray by 1%
9. I also implemented random forest classifier which almost gave the same accuracy just 0.002 point increase
10. In the end, i choose random forest

so when i executed on my PC, i got an accuracy of 0.998
